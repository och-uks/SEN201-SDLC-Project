PROJECT: Student calculator

          SDLC DOCUMENTATION:
1. Requirement Analysis: The application must take a numerical score from a student an return a letter grade(A,C or F)
 2: Design
Nomenclature: To ensure consistency between design and code, we define these specific variables:
score: The numerical input provided by the user.
letter_grade: The resulting character (A, B, C, D, or F).
grade_point: The numerical weight (e.g., 5 for A, 4 for B).
Grading Logic:
70 – 100: A (5 points)
60 – 69: B (4 points)
50 – 59: C (3 points)
45 – 49: D (2 points)
0 – 44: F (0 points)
 3: Implementation (Coding)
The logic is written into a script. The variable names used here match the Nomenclature defined in Phase 2.
 4: Testing
Input: Score of 85.
Expected Output: Letter Grade: A, Grade Point: 5.
Boundary Test: Score of 45. Expected Output: Letter Grade: D.
 5: Deployment
The code is committed and pushed to a GitHub repository for version control and submission.
